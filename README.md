2. Enter proper provider and url for **mysql** db connection in schema.prisma file
3. Define models in **schema.prisma** file
4. Run commands _**prisma generate**_ and _**prisma db push**_ to initialise _prisma client_ and connect it with the database. This steps also involves translating your models into mysql tables.
